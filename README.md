# Model Deployment Using Flask for Handwritten Digit Recognition
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja, and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

This repository demonstrates how to deploy a machine learning model using Flask for recognizing handwritten digits. The deployed model predicts the digits(0 to 9) using convolutional neural network.
